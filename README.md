# GUI Control Panel for Sway

This is a work in progress attempt at creating a GUI interface for the sway
control panel. Many features are not implemented, but many are! 

## Design 

This application is designed in a way to make it as modular as possible to
adapt to any changes to the sway config.

## Motivation 

While editing the config by hand is the ideal way to do this for some people,
some operations are much easier when done with a GUI. Positioning bars,
defining colors, gap sizes, etc...
